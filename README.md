I conducted a Churn Analysis for a hypothetical telecommunications company named Databel using Tableau. This analysis delved into various factors contributing to customer churn, such as the underlying reasons for churn, differences in churn rates across categories and states. I also investigated churn rates among different age groups, examining the impact of the number of individuals in a plan and the type of data plans, including international options. Additionally, the analysis covered the influence of payment methods and contract types on churn. All these analyses, summaries, and dashboards were compiled into a comprehensive story for a thorough understanding of churn dynamics at Databel.
